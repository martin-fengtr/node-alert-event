This is a [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) project for the alert event client app.

Some key points:

- TypeScript
- ESLint + Prettier setup


Basically app support 2 endpoints:

- /api/events/test
- /api/events/save

Under the hood, both endpoints are doing same thing - just validate the request and return JSON object.
